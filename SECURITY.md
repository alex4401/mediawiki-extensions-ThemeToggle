# Security Policy

## MediaWiki support policy
Only specific MediaWiki versions are supported:
* Versions currently in use (or with active upgrade plans) at wiki.gg;
* Rarely, newer releases than previously mentioned if support is requested through the "Issues" tab on the GitHub repository.

In case of identical branches handling multiple MediaWiki releases, depreciation warnings are NOT going to be sorted out
if issues may arise in older supported releases.

## Extension support policy
Only the latest version of the extension receives active support. Exceptions may apply.

## Reporting a vulnerability
To report a vulnerability of any sort, either:
* Navigate over to the "Security" tab of the GitHub repository and fill out the private vulnerability reporting form;
* or send an e-mail to *rylatgl [plus sign] mops [at] gmail [dot] com*.

A patch will be issued whenever possible, within reason in regards to the severity and complexity.
